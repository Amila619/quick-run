# Batch Scripts Automation Repo

This repository contains batch scripts for various automation tasks.

## React Init Script

The `react-init` batch script automates the setup of a new React project:

- Creates a new React project.
- Installs required dependencies.
- Opens the project in VS Code.
- Launches a Firefox window.

> **Note:** Remember to have Vite installed globally before running the script. You can install it using:
> ```sh
> npm install -g create-vite
> ```

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want your React project.
3. Run the script:
    ```bat
    react-init MyProject
    ```
    Replace `MyProject` with your desired project name.

The script will create the project, install dependencies, open VS Code, and launch Firefox automatically.
